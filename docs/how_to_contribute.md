# 1. Overview

This project is an open-source, general Playground product (front-end
repository) for Web3, developed based on Amphitheatre, aiming to help developers
better learn Web3 development. It is jointly initiated by Amphitheatre and
OpenBuild.

> If you are interested in other tasks of this Playground, please visit:
> - API: https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/playground-api
> - Buildpacks: https://github.com/amp-buildpacks

We welcome developers to contribute to this project, including code
contributions, testing, and documentation writing. 👏

# 2. Why Participate

We believe that developers can not only improve their technical skills but also
build better personal influence in the community by participating in open-source
contributions.

Therefore, we encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects.

**Don’t worry about your ability; you can start with the simplest tasks. The
most important thing is to take the first step.**

We recommend reading this article: [Why Participate in the Open Source
Community?](https://shardingsphere.apache.org/blog/cn/material/open_source_community/)

Of course, in addition to the mentioned open-source “gifts,” we will also
provide various types of material incentives for everyone, sincerely thanking
everyone for their contributions!

**But please note, we don’t want everyone to just participate for the sake of
making money**, but rather, we believe that participating in open source and the
community is beneficial for long-term growth and recognizes the value of this
project.

## 2.1 Bounty Incentives

We will post some development tasks as [Task
Issues](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/playground/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATask),
labeled with a Task tag 🏷️.

Interested parties can evaluate the development time (in hours) in the
corresponding issue, and we will select the most suitable developers from them
and assign the task to them.

**After the task is completed and the PR is passed, we will reward $5 per
hour.💰**

Each Task has 3 states:

- recruiting: indicates that the task has not started, and developers are
  evaluating it
- building: indicates that the task is under development
- completed: indicates that the task has been completed

> Rewards will be distributed within 3 days after the PR is completed, through
> USDT. Distribution records: [Contribution Incentives
> Disclosure](https://github.com/amphitheatre-app/playground/issues/4)
>
> The reward amount may change later depending on the situation, but it will not
> affect ongoing or completed tasks.


## 2.2 OpenBuild SBT Incentives

For developers who actively contribute (>=40 hours), we will issue OpenBuild
SBT. By holding OpenBuild, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- OpenBuild custom peripherals
- OpenBuild platform Bounty / recruitment green channel
- Help build personal technical influence
- Developer growth package (high-value tutorials, technical books, various
  development platform credits / licenses, etc.)
- Potential partner airdrops
- Other benefits


# 3. How to Participate
